BlueSky is meant as a tool to perform research on Air Traffic Management and Air Traffic Flows, and is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.

The goal of BlueSky is to provide everybody who wants to visualize, analyze or simulate air
traffic with a tool to do so without any restrictions, licenses or limitations. It can be copied,
modified, cited, etc. without any limitations.

This specific branch allows the uses of custom servers and server events to be implemented through means of a custom_server and custom_event plugin. This can be useful in the case where a centralized component has to control what happens in the different parallel threads. An example is provided for usage of the custom server and events for multi-core Reinforcement Learning, where a centralized agent is maintained in the server and the different clients request actions from this agent.



## Starting BlueSky with a custom server:

A custom server can be started from the terminal by executing the command: 
```console
python BlueSky.py --customserver "name_of_serverfile"
```

Additional nodes can be added through initialization of a batch scenario file or by manually clicking the add node button in the GUI.

## Creating your own custom server:

To create your own custom server you should create a CustomServer(Server) class within the plugins folder. To add additional functionality to the server class you can alter the customevent(self, eventname, src, dest, msg, route, data, sender_id) function which should return the boolean variable msgpassed, which is True is the custom server did handle the message and False otherwise.

For an example implementation of a custom server, see DRL_server.py under the plugins folder.

Next to this you probably also need a custom event handler which handles custom messages send by the server on the client side. Messages send by the server to a specific client pass through the "process" function within the clients custom event handler which checks if the message are relevant for them. Change this function to ensure that the messages that are send through the custom server also reach the client.

For an example implemntation of a custom event handler, see custom_events.py under the plugins folder.

## BlueSky Wiki
Installation and user guides are accessible at:
https://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky/wiki

## Some features of BlueSky:
- Written in the freely available, ultra-simple-hence-easy-to-learn, multi-platform language
Python 3 (using numpy and either pygame or Qt+OpenGL for visualisation) with source
- Extensible by means of self-contained [plugins](https://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky/wiki/plugin)
- Contains open source data on navaids, performance data of aircraft and geography
- Global coverage navaid and airport data
- Contains simulations of aircraft performance, flight management system (LNAV, VNAV under construction),
autopilot, conflict detection and resolution and airborne separation assurance systems
- Compatible with BADA 3.x data
- Compatible wth NLR Traffic Manager TMX as used by NLR and NASA LaRC
- Traffic is controlled via user inputs in a console window or by playing scenario files (.SCN)
containing the same commands with a time stamp before the command ("HH:MM:SS.hh>")
- Mouse clicks in traffic window are use in console for lat/lon/heading and position inputs

## Contributions
BlueSky can be considered 'perpetual beta'. We would like to encourage anyone with a strong interest in
ATM and/or Python to join us. Please feel free to comment, criticise, and contribute to this project. Please send suggestions, proposed changes or contributions through GitHub pull requests, preferably after debugging it and optimising it for run-time performance.
